## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Analytics Tables
CREATE TABLE analytics_events (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    user_id BIGINT,
    provider_id BIGINT,
    data JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE daily_metrics (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE,
    provider_id BIGINT,
    total_bookings INT,
    total_revenue DECIMAL(10,2),
    cancellation_rate DECIMAL(5,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE provider_analytics (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    provider_id BIGINT,
    metric_name VARCHAR(100),
    metric_value DECIMAL(15,2),
    period_start DATE,
    period_end DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### API Endpoints Structure
```
Provider Dashboard APIs:
GET /api/provider/dashboard/overview
GET /api/provider/appointments
